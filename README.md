# Android Programming with Kotlin for Beginners
Projects are from Android Programming with Kotlin for Beginners (Packt, John Horton)

# Chapter 2
Simple hello world project

## Features of project:
1. Created a simple android app from Basic Activity.
2. Implemented button using 2 different methods (Design and Code)
3. Buttons would trigger Toast and Log messages

## Things I have learnt:
1. How to setup a project from scratch
2. How to design simple buttons via code or the design method.
3. Learnt the function of onCreate and where I can declare other functions.
4. Learnt to use Toast for notifying users when something is done, like maybe a downloaded file.
5. Learnt to use Log for logging purposes, which is visible on logcat.

# Chapter 3
Example codes for Basic Activity and Empty Activity

## Features of project:
1. Example codes from Basic Activity and Empty Activity templates

Note: As the purpose of this chapter is to get familiarized with the file layout/UI of Android Studio, there is no new features except for the template code.

## Things I have learnt:
1. Permissions can be configured in the AndroidManifest file.
2. Styles like Light and Dark mode can be configured in styles.xml file, under the resource folder.
3. The overall layout of files enable different teams to work together at the same time (Design, Programmer, Testers, etc.)
4. XML files across the app will have convoluted references across the directory, but everything is interconnected.
