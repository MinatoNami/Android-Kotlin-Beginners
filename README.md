# Android Programming with Kotlin for Beginners
Projects are from Android Programming with Kotlin for Beginners (Packt, John Horton)

# Chapter 2
Simple hello world project

## Features of project:
1. Created a simple android app from Basic Activity.
2. Implemented button using 2 different methods (Design and Code)
3. Buttons would trigger Toast and Log messages

## Things I have learnt:
1. How to setup a project from scratch
2. How to design simple buttons via code or the design method.
3. Learnt the function of onCreate and where I can declare other functions.
4. Learnt to use Toast for notifying users when something is done, like maybe a downloaded file.
5. Learnt to use Log for logging purposes, which is visible on logcat.

# Chapter 3
Example codes for Basic Activity and Empty Activity

## Features of project:
1. Example codes from Basic Activity and Empty Activity templates

Note: As the purpose of this chapter is to get familiarized with the file layout/UI of Android Studio, there is no new features except for the template code.

## Things I have learnt:
1. Permissions can be configured in the AndroidManifest file.
2. Styles like Light and Dark mode can be configured in styles.xml file, under the resource folder.
3. The overall layout of files enable different teams to work together at the same time (Design, Programmer, Testers, etc.)
4. XML files across the app will have convoluted references across the directory, but everything is interconnected.

# Chapter 4
Example using ConstraintLayout, TableLayout, and a menu to toggle between the two.

## Features of project:
1. ConstraintLayout - Contains multiple components constraint to each other. Includes a calendar widget, text button and an image view
2. Tablelayout - Sample 2 by 2 table with configured layout columns
3. Main menu - Made using a linearlayout, features buttons that can switch between different pages.

## Things I have learnt:
1. The TableLayout can be useful for listing out things table format with headers and rows.
2. I have learnt to switch between different pages using setContextView. Need to explore how can I improve the switching using transitions between views.
3. I have learnt how to use constraints to allow easier designing of components, since it enables multiple edits of position, relative to another component.
